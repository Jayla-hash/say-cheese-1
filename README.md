However, support is planned for the next major releases of both browsers.

### Mac OS 10.11+:

| copy from / paste to  | Firefox  | Chrome   | Safari 10+ |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| Mac Finder            |    1)    |    OK    |    -       |
| Mac Finder Screenshot |    OK    |    OK    |    OK      |
| Mac Preview           |    OK    |    OK    |    OK      |
| Mac Photos App        |    1)    |    OK    |    2)      |
| QuickTime Player      |    OK    |    OK    |    OK      |
| Photoshop CS 6        |    OK    |    OK    |    ?       |
| Photoshop CC (2017)   |    OK    |    OK    |    OK      |

| Gimp                  |    OK    |    OK    |    OK      |

**1)** Nothing happens. As a Workaround paste into Mac Preview first and then copy again.
**2)** The file icon is pasted. Use a workaround.


### Windows 10

**1)** Alpha channels are discarded
**2)** Alpha channels are discarded and replaced by some weird artifacts.

 	- [ ] Find reliable way to predict supported WebcamSizes
 - [x] use different default file names for paste and snapshot
 - [ ] Add Messages after upload Error
