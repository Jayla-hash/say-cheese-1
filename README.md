Say Cheese
==========

Take a webcam snapshot and upload it to the WordPress Media Library.

 - Developed in WP 3.8 â€“ WP 4.8
 - Should work with WordPress 3.5+
 - German and Dutch localization. 

*Note:* Clipboard image pasting now lives in [The Paste](https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-paste).

Browser Support
---------------

A WebRTC or ORTC capable Browser is required.  
At the time of writgin these were:

 - Chrome 32+ (WebRTC, requires a https connection)
 - Firefox 26+ (WebRTC)
 - Microsoft Edge 13+ (ORTC)

As you can see, IE, Safari and iOS are not supported. But [there is hope](https://webrtc.ventures/2017/06/webrtc-support-in-safari-11/).


ToDo:
-----
 - [ ] Select recording size (QVGA, VGA, SVGA, HD, FullHD)
    - [ ] Find a reliable way to predict supported WebcamSizes
 - [ ] Add Messages after upload Error
