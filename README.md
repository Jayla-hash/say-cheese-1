Say Cheese
==========

Take a webcam snapshot or paste image data and upload it into the WordPress Media Library.

 - Developed in WP 3.8
   Should work with WordPress 3.5+
 
 - German localization.

Browser Support
---------------
Paste and snapshot work well in current Chrome and Firefox. 
Snapshot fallback for IE and Safari planned.
Paste in Safari won't be supported as long as [this bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49141) remains unfixed.


ToDo:
-----
 - iOS6 support: http://www.purplesquirrels.com.au/2013/08/webcam-to-canvas-or-data-uri-with-html5-and-javascript/
 - add MSIE support
 - disable paste in safari. Requires an answer for [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21366465/is-there-a-way-to-detect-webkit-fake-url-browser-behavior).
 - snapshot flash fallback.
 - snapshot: disable record button on uninitialized camera
